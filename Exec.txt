There are three spots where hash is not checked where  Executable does not check for Hash Signature

the Checksum in the optional Windows specific header. 4 bytes.
the Certificate Table entry in the optional Windows specific header. 8 bytes.
the Digital Certificate section at the end of the file. Variable lengtha

The data in this are ignored by both the signature parsing and hash computation algorithm

Here is the detailed step

Locate beginning of PE header (PE)
Skip COFF header (+=28 bytes)
Go to Certification Table Entry in the Windows specific optional PE header (+=120 bytes after COFF; total +=148 bytes)
Change size of Certificate Table as defined in IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY.Size to add the size of the payload.
Go to location defined IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY.VirtualAddress. This is the absolute location of the Certificate Table within the file.
Change again the size of the header, inside the PKCS1_MODULE_SIGN.dwLength
This should normally be the last section in the executable; so go to the end and add payload
Possibly calculate the new checksum of the file
